        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Bavly Fayed. Originally from Cairo, Egypt, I relocated to the U.S. six years ago with my family, and the journey has been anything but easy. Adjusting to a new country at a young age meant navigating cultural differences, language barriers, and an unfamiliar education system, all while striving to keep up academically. The early days were challenging—I often felt out of place and overwhelmed. However, through perseverance, I adapted, using these struggles to fuel my growth. As a junior in Computer Science at Iowa State University, I've applied my skills in real-world environments, including an internship at Vontas where I worked on software development projects involving Spring Boot and RabbitMQ. Balancing my studies and the pressures of an internship was no small feat, but these experiences taught me resilience, sharpened my technical skills, and strengthened my resolve to push through challenges. Today, I’m more driven than ever to turn these experiences into opportunities to innovate and contribute to the field of technology.</p>
